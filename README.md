## Instructions
### Using the git repo

1. Clone this git repository to your computer.
2. On your computer, make a new branch titled "add-[your name]-readme" (you can do this using the `git branch` command)
3. Switch over to that branch (try the `git checkout` command). You can make sure you're on the right branch by using `git branch`
4. Open the README (on your computer), and add your name to this list:
  - Name 1
  - Name 2
  - Name 3
  - Name 4
  - Name 5  
 
5. Commit these changes (`git commit`)
6. Push your changes to GitHub (`git push`)
7. Open the repository on GitHub, and create a pull request to merge your branch to the main branch. Make a little note to let others know what you changed :smile:
8. Accept someone else's pull request! Write them a note to let them know they did a good job (or maybe let them know if there's a typo).
