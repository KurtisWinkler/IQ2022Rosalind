# IQ 2022 Rosalind Exercises

## Instructions
### Using the git repo

1. Clone this git repository to your computer.
2. On your computer, make a new branch titled "add-[your name]-readme" (you can do this using the `git branch` command)
3. Switch over to that branch (try the `git checkout` command). You can make sure you're on the right branch by using `git branch`
4. Open the README (on your computer), and add your name to this list:
  - Name 1
  - Name 2
  - Name 3
  - Name 4
  - Name 5  
 
5. Commit these changes (`git commit`)
6. Push your changes to GitHub (`git push`)
7. Open the repository on GitHub, and create a pull request to merge your branch to the main branch. Make a little note to let others know what you changed :smile:
8. Accept someone else's pull request! Write them a note to let them know they did a good job (or maybe let them know if there's a typo).


### Rosalind
9. Navigate to the [Rosalind website](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/).
10. Make an account on Rosalind. 
11. Checkout the main branch, and use `git pull` pull any changes.
12. Make a branch for your group, titled "[group name]-DNA-counting". Then, checkout that branch.
13. As a group, write a script titled `DNA-counting.py`, which solves the first problem on the list, and test it. 
14. Commit and push your changes.
15. We'll try to regroup after the first problem, do a short code review, and then merge one version of `DNA-counting.py` to our main branch. 
16. Checkout the main branch, and use `git pull` pull any changes.
17. If time permits, pick another problem that looks fun, and work on that as a group, using the same "branch -> checkout -> write code -> commit -> push -> merge" process.
